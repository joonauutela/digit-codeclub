# Employee API

## Task

Employee API currently has one endpoint:

```

- GET http://localhost:3001/employees/?id={id} -> get specific employee
```

There are two major security vulnerabilities in this application. One is related to the database and one is related to securing the API. Try to find and exploit them and then fix them.

## Local development

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start application on port 3001:

```
npm start
```
