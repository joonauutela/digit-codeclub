# Session one

Welcome to the first session of Digit code club 2024.

## Task

Employee application consists of two pages: employee list and employee contact information. Employee contact information page can be found by clicking the 'employee id' cell in the employees table.

Employee contact information currently shows placeholder mock data. Replace it with actual data:

- Fix backend application to return contact information as JSON data for specific employee id.
- Fetch contact information data from the backend API in the frontend application. Display fetched data in the UI.
- Add unit tests for new feature and check that all the tests pass.
